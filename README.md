# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is my 4th project for the "The Odin Project" and in this project, I will be making a website where one can draw on a grid of squares, similar to an etch a sketch with either a solid color, a rainbow color or gradient color with the option to erase the color from any grid if needed. This project will be made with html, css and js, specifically with dom manipulation.
